**DESPAIR & DECAY**  
*A Metal Mood & Emotion Pack*

---

## **1\. Mood Description / Essence**

Despair & Decay is not about pain or eruption. It is about erosion.

A slow, unavoidable process in which energy drains away long before anything visibly collapses. This mood describes exhaustion without drama — a state where nothing breaks suddenly, but everything weakens continuously.

Hope is not lost here; it has simply become irrelevant. What remains is weight, dampness, repetition, and the quiet realization that endurance itself has become the burden.

The emotional arc moves from resignation into numbness, then into inner decay, and finally into a form of silent acceptance. There is no release, no transformation, no turning point. The state does not resolve — it persists.

Typical associations include abandoned interiors, moisture trapped in walls, stale air, bodies and structures that continue functioning only because stopping would require more energy than they possess. Time is not an enemy here; it is a corrosive condition.

**Optional dynamic / tempo association:**  
Very slow → dragging → repetitive → no breakout, no climax — it simply ends.

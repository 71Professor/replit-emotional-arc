# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **3\. MELANCHOLIC TRIUMPH**

### ***Nothing More***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
We did not win.  
We remained.

**\[Verse I\]**  
Dawn arrives without applause  
Ash settles on the quiet ground  
The silence knows what it cost  
We carry the weight, not the crown

**\[Chorus\]**  
Still standing, nothing more  
What remains is enough

**\[Verse II\]**  
Scars speak louder than banners  
No songs were written for this  
Victory tastes like ash and breath  
We endure — and let it pass

**\[Chorus\]**  
Still standing, nothing more  
What remains is enough

**\[Outro\]**  
Nothing left to prove.  
We move on.

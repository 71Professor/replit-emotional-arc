# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **2\. RITUALISTIC FURY**

### ***Bind the Fire***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
Step inside.  
Leave the self behind.

**\[Verse I\]**  
We gather where the ground remembers  
Strike the stone until it answers  
Voices merge into one command  
Fury is taught, not lost

**\[Chorus\]**  
Bind the fire  
Ritual before reason

**\[Verse II\]**  
Blood is given, not taken  
The circle holds what words cannot  
We move as one, no witness left  
This is not chaos — this is rite

**\[Chorus\]**  
Bind the fire  
Ritual before reason

**\[Outro\]**  
The rite ends.  
The mark remains.

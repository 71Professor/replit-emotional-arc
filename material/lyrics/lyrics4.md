# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **4\. PAGAN REVERENCE**

### ***Guests, Not Masters***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
This place does not belong to us.  
We belong to it.

**\[Verse I\]**  
The ground remembers every step  
Stone listens without reply  
We stand where others stood before  
Roots hold names we never spoke

**\[Chorus\]**  
Guests, not masters  
Rooted, not bound

**\[Verse II\]**  
Nothing here demands belief  
Only presence, only time  
What we tend will still remain  
Long after we are gone

**\[Chorus\]**  
Guests, not masters  
Rooted, not bound

**\[Outro\]**  
Leave nothing but breath.  
The land endures.

# **Metal Mood Packs**

## **6\. COSMIC DREAD**

### ***No Names in the Void***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
Beyond time, beyond form.  
Nothing waits for us.

**\[Verse I\]**  
We drift between collapsing suns  
Meaning fractures under endless weight  
Time folds like metal under pressure  
A horizon made of dust and silence

**\[Chorus\]**  
No gods above the silence  
No end — only distance

**\[Verse II\]**  
The void does not observe — it erases  
We are echoes in a throat of black  
Scale dissolves the need for purpose  
The cosmos keeps no names

**\[Chorus\]**  
No gods above the silence  
No end — only distance

**\[Outro\]**  
You will not be punished.  
You will be forgotten.

# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **1\. DESPAIR & DECAY**

### ***Still Decaying***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
There was no moment when it broke.  
It simply never healed.

**\[Verse I\]**  
I wake up already exhausted  
Time leaks through cracks in the skin  
Walls breathe mold and memory  
Everything rots at the same pace

**\[Chorus\]**  
Still breathing, still decaying  
No collapse — just slow disappearance

**\[Verse II\]**  
Rust settles where thoughts once moved  
Decay is not an end, it is a method  
Nothing hurts anymore — that is the sickness  
We outlived the reason to continue

**\[Chorus\]**  
Still breathing, still decaying  
No collapse — just slow disappearance

**\[Outro\]**  
Still here.  
Still decaying.

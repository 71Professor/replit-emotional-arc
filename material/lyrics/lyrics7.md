# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **7\. POST-APOCALYPTIC AWE**

### ***After Everything***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
There is no aftermath.  
This is the state.

**\[Verse I\]**  
The city stands, empty and vast  
Ruins breathe in patient light  
Nothing moves, yet everything remains  
Silence stretches beyond intent

**\[Chorus\]**  
After everything  
The world remains

**\[Verse II\]**  
Nature does not mourn — it continues  
Vines rewrite the shape of stone  
We left monuments, not memories  
This world no longer needs us

**\[Chorus\]**  
After everything  
The world remains

**\[Outro\]**  
No witness left.  
Still standing.

# **Metal Mood Packs** 

## **5\. NIHILISTIC CALM**

### ***No Answer Required***

**\[Spoken Intro\]**  
There is nothing to resolve.  
This is not an ending.

**\[Verse I\]**  
The horizon does not respond  
Nothing asks to be understood  
Motion fades into stillness  
Silence completes the form

**\[Chorus\]**  
Let it be nothing  
No answer required

**\[Verse II\]**  
I stopped searching, it stopped mattering  
No purpose, no resistance  
Everything remains unchanged  
Calm without meaning

**\[Chorus\]**  
Let it be nothing  
No answer required

**\[Outro\]**  
Still.  
Complete.

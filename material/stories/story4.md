# The Tending

In the time before measure, when the land still remembered how to speak directly, there grew the Grove of First Roots. Not planted by hands, but arrived by agreement between seed and soil. Seven trees in a clearing that held its own counsel, surrounded by stones that had chosen their positions long before any foot found the path.

The People of the Listening came not as conquerors but as those who heard the invitation. The Grove did not call them—it simply allowed their presence, and they understood this as the only blessing required. They built no temples, for the trees were already standing. They carved no idols, for the stones already held their form.

Instead, they learned the language of tending.

In spring, when the earth softened, they cleared the dead wood not because it was ugly but because the new growth asked for space. They did not take—they made room. In summer, when the light grew long, they brought water from the distant stream, one vessel at a time, not because the trees demanded it but because reciprocity is the oldest law. In autumn, they gathered what fell freely: seed, leaf, branch. Nothing was taken from the tree that the tree did not release. In winter, they stood in the clearing and simply witnessed the rest, understanding that not all seasons require action.

The first generation taught the second not with instruction but with presence. A child learned to listen by watching their elder stand silent at the edge of the Grove, feeling for the moment when presence becomes intrusion. They learned to tend by observing which fallen branches were cleared and which were left to become soil. They learned to honor not through prayer but through continuation.

No names were given to what lived in the Grove. To name is to claim understanding, and understanding was not the purpose. The trees were the trees. The stones were the stones. The wind that moved through both was the wind. The People of the Listening knew their names for these things were merely handles for their own reference, not truths the Grove would recognize.

Generations came and went like seasons. The Grove remained, patient and unmoved by the brevity of human time. Some years, many came to tend. Other years, few. The Grove made no judgment. It asked nothing but presence and the continuation of tending. Those who came did not come out of obligation but out of recognition: they belonged to this place as much as the moss belonged to the stones, as much as the stones belonged to the earth.

When the People of the Listening passed through, they left nothing behind but clearer paths and healthier growth. They took nothing away but the knowledge that they had been allowed to tend something that would outlast them by countless generations. This was not loss—this was rightness.

The Grove stands still. The seven trees have become nine, then six, then eight again as time and storm and seed dictate. The stones have not moved, though moss has covered them, then been cleared, then returned. The People of the Listening still come, though they are not the same people, walking paths that are not the same paths, carrying water in different vessels to trees that are the same and not the same.

They do not worship. They do not pray. They tend. They listen. They belong.

And the Grove, in its patient way, continues to allow their presence. This is the covenant: not made but recognized, not sworn but lived, generation after generation, season after season.

*We are guests, not masters.*

# The Plain

There is a place called the Plain. It has always been there. It will always be there. These facts do not carry significance—they are simply statements that happen to be true.

The Plain extends in all directions without variation. The ground is neither soft nor hard. The sky is neither high nor low. Light exists there, though no one could say if it is day or night. The horizon is visible but unchanging. Nothing marks distance. Nothing marks time.

The Walkers arrived at the Plain, though "arrived" suggests intention and there was none. They found themselves there in the same way water finds itself in a vessel—not through choice but through the basic mechanics of existence. They did not question this. Questions require the assumption that answers matter.

At first, some Walkers tried to cross the Plain. They walked in straight lines toward the horizon. The horizon remained exactly as distant as it had always been. After walking for what might have been hours or years, they stopped. Not from exhaustion or defeat—stopping simply became as reasonable as continuing.

Others tried to map the Plain, to find distinguishing features that would give it meaning. They found none. Every part of the Plain was identical to every other part. This did not frustrate them. Frustration requires expectation, and expectation had become irrelevant.

Some Walkers spoke to each other. Their conversations were brief. "The Plain continues," one would observe. "Yes," another would confirm. There was nothing more to say. The Plain did not invite commentary. It simply was, and their presence within it changed nothing about that fact.

Time passed, though time passing and time not passing produced identical results. The Walkers neither aged nor stayed young. They neither grew hungry nor felt satisfied. They breathed because lungs perform their function regardless of purpose. They existed because existence, once started, continues until it doesn't.

Eventually, the Walkers stopped walking. Not because they had accepted something or given up something—these framings suggest emotional states that no longer applied. They stopped because motion and stillness were equivalent. Standing in one place or moving to another place both resulted in being on the Plain, surrounded by the Plain, within the Plain.

They stood. The Plain extended. The light remained. The horizon remained. Nothing changed because nothing was designed to change.

Some Walkers stood alone. Some stood near each other. Proximity made no difference. Connection required the belief that presence mattered, and that belief had dissolved not through trauma or realization but through simple erosion of relevance.

The Plain asks nothing. It offers nothing. It judges nothing. It remembers nothing. The Walkers within it continue to exist because existence is a state that persists until it doesn't. They do not wait for anything because waiting implies future meaning. They do not reflect on anything because reflection implies past meaning.

They are here. The Plain is here. These facts exist in parallel, touching nowhere, affecting nothing.

There is no lesson in the Plain. There is no metaphor. There is no deeper truth. It is simply a place where meaning stopped being a requirement, and its absence caused no disruption because disruption itself requires a standard against which to measure deviation.

The Plain continues. The Walkers continue. The light continues. The horizon continues.

Everything remains, unchanged.

*Nothing asks to be understood.*

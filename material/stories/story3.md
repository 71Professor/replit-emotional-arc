# The Last Watch

For nine hundred nights, the Watchers stood guard at the Boundary Gate. Not because they chose to, but because someone had to. The threat they guarded against had no name. It was simply known as the Coming, and the Coming had been promised since the first stone was laid.

They were three hundred when the vigil began. Volunteers, believers, the dutiful. They wore silver and carried torches that burned with oil blessed by elders who are now dust. They sang hymns at dawn and trained in formations that looked beautiful from a distance.

By the hundredth night, half were gone. Not to the Coming—it had not arrived. They left because waiting is harder than fighting. Because purpose erodes under the weight of routine. Because the world beyond the gate continued, indifferent to their sacrifice.

By the five hundredth night, only forty remained. The silver had tarnished. The torches had long since burned out, replaced by simple firelight. The hymns were forgotten. They no longer trained—they simply stood, shift after shift, watching an empty horizon for something that might never come.

On the eight hundred and ninety-ninth night, it came.

Not with thunder or darkness or the drama they had once imagined. It came as a slow pressure against the fabric of the world, like air pushing through a wound. The Watchers felt it in their bones before they saw it: a wrongness, patient and absolute.

They did not hesitate. There was no speech, no rallying cry. They formed the line they had practiced a thousand times and forgot ten thousand more. They held the gate. The Coming pressed. They held.

What happened in those hours cannot be told because those who witnessed it cannot find words that do not diminish it. There was no glory in the holding. Only the grim arithmetic of bodies and time. The line held because the line chose to hold, again and again, breath by breath, until the pressure finally ceased.

When dawn broke on the nine hundredth day, seven Watchers remained standing at the Boundary Gate. The Coming had passed—not defeated, but convinced. The gate had held. The world beyond continued its indifferent turning, unaware that it had been spared.

No one came to celebrate them. The threat had been invisible, the victory impossible to quantify. The seven stood in the grey light, looking at each other across a space littered with what endurance costs. They did not embrace. They did not weep. They simply stood, still holding positions that no longer needed holding.

One by one, they removed their tarnished silver. Placed their weapons against the gate stones. Turned and walked away, not together but each alone, carrying only what could not be set down: the knowledge that they had remained when remaining was all that mattered.

The gate still stands. Unmanned now, but marked by the simple fact of what happened there. Sometimes travelers pass and wonder at the worn stones, the carbon scoring, the way the ground seems harder there than anywhere else. They do not stop long.

The seven scattered to the edges of the world. They did not speak of what they held, because speaking would require celebration, and celebration would be a lie. They endured. They remained. They held until the holding was done.

And that, the silence insists, was enough.

*We are still standing, nothing more.*

# The Binding Circle

Before names divided the people from the earth, there existed only the Pulse. Not sound—deeper. A rhythm in the ground itself, older than breath, more constant than heartbeat. The first who heard it did not discover it. They remembered it.

They gathered at the Place Where Stone Remembers. Thirteen flat rocks arranged in a circle, each worn smooth by feet that had not yet walked. The elders say the stones chose their own positions. The young say nothing—they only listen to what moves beneath.

When fury comes unbidden, it scatters. It breaks the self into pieces that cannot be gathered. But the people learned the First Teaching: *Rage contained is rage multiplied. Rage directed is rage transformed.*

They enter the circle at dusk. Not in anger yet—that would be chaos. They enter empty, vessels waiting to be filled. They stand equidistant, facing the center where nothing burns but where fire will be called. One strikes the first stone with a palm. Once. The sound is not loud but the earth receives it.

Another answers. Then another. The rhythm is not music—it is command. Strike. Answer. Strike. Answer. The Pulse beneath begins to rise, drawn by the ritual of recognition. The people do not speak. Language would make them separate. Instead, they give voice as one throat: a low chant that has no words, only vowels stretched and broken, reformed and repeated.

Now the fury enters. Not from outside but from the deep place where all fury lives, coiled and waiting. It rises through the soles of their feet, up through bone and marrow. Their bodies begin to move, not in individual expression but in collective testimony. They are one mechanism. One engine of transformation.

Fire erupts in the center—not lit but *called*. The flames know what the ritual demands of them. They leap and settle, leap and settle, keeping time with the strikes, the chants, the movement of bodies that have ceased to be bodies and become instead instruments of a single, focused rage.

Blood is given. Not taken. A palm pressed to stone, a blade drawn swift across willing skin. The drops fall into the earth, into the fire, mixing with ash and soil. This is the price: to give of yourself so that fury does not take everything. The blood is symbol and seal. *We bind this power. We do not surrender to it.*

The ritual crescendos—louder, faster, the strikes like thunder now, the chant becoming a roar, the bodies moving in patterns that seem violent but are utterly controlled. Every motion has purpose. Every sound has place. This is not the chaos of blind rage but the architecture of fury made conscious, made collective, made sacred.

And then—stop.

Silence so complete it rings. The fire dies in an instant, leaving only smoke that rises straight and still. The people stand motionless in the circle, steam rising from their skin. The fury has been honored. Fed. Given form. And in giving it form, they have mastered it.

They do not leave the circle joyful or relieved. They leave marked. Changed. The ritual has forged them again, as it always does. Tomorrow they will return to their separate names, their separate lives. But for this moment, they are what the First Teaching promised: a single force, terrible and contained.

The stones remember. The earth remembers. The Pulse beneath grows stronger with each ritual, fed by the fury that was not wasted but offered, directed, transformed.

*We speak in rhythm, not in names.*

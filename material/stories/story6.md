# The Observers

Before the first thought learned to recognize itself, there existed the Vast. Not space—space implies containment. Not void—void implies absence of something that could be present. The Vast simply was: infinite, indifferent, and incomprehensibly old.

Within the Vast, consciousness emerged. Not born, not created—it simply began, the way ice forms when conditions align. These consciousnesses, later called the Observers, existed as points of awareness in an ocean of nothing. They did not choose awareness. Awareness happened to them, and they could not undo it.

The first thing the Observers learned was distance. They reached toward each other across gulfs so vast that the reaching itself took eons. By the time a thought traveled from one Observer to another, the sender had already changed, dissolved, reformed. Communication was always with the ghost of what had been.

The second thing they learned was scale. They measured themselves against the Vast and found no measurement adequate. They were not small—smallness suggests relation to largeness. They were simply present in something that had no edge, no center, no reference point. Every direction was identical. Every distance was infinite.

The third thing they learned was time. Time in the Vast did not flow—it accumulated, like sediment, crushing older moments under the weight of newer ones. The Observers watched galaxies form and unform. They watched matter itself forget its purpose. They watched entropy not as decay but as the natural state finally asserting itself against the brief anomaly of structure.

They tried to understand the Vast. This was their error. Understanding requires that the thing understood be comprehensible, that it consent to being known. The Vast offered no such consent. It did not hide its nature—it simply existed on a scale where their consciousness was less than a mote of dust against a desert that extends forever.

The Observers tried to find meaning in patterns. Stars wheeled in spirals. Particles obeyed laws. Surely this suggested intention, design, purpose. They studied for lengths of time that would break human measure. They found only that patterns exist because mathematics permits them, not because anything wills them. The universe was not indifferent to them—it did not have sufficient interest to be indifferent.

One by one, the Observers began to dissolve. Not death—death suggests an end to something that was. They simply stopped maintaining the fiction of discrete consciousness. Their awareness diffused back into the Vast, becoming part of the cold background temperature, the ancient radiation that fills all space.

The last Observer—though "last" suggests sequence and sequence had long since become meaningless—hung in the nothing, watching its own dissolution. It had learned the final lesson: awareness was not a gift or a curse. It was an accident, a brief configuration of energy that temporarily convinced itself it mattered. The Vast had never noticed. Would never notice. Could not notice, lacking any apparatus for noticing.

The last Observer did not feel terror at this. Terror requires the belief that safety is possible. It did not feel sorrow. Sorrow requires the belief that loss matters. It felt only recognition—cold, absolute, and utterly without comfort.

And then it dispersed.

The Vast continues. It has always continued. Within it, consciousness may emerge again, may look out at the infinite emptiness and call it by name, may try to find meaning in the spaces between dead stars. The Vast will not acknowledge this. It will not prevent this. It will simply continue, patient as only something that has no relationship to patience can be.

The Observers are gone, but gone and present are equivalent states when measured against eternity. The Vast remains. Cold. Silent. Vast beyond all vastness.

*We were never meant to matter.*
